# Generating Videos with H26Forge

To generate a video with the default configurations, you can run:
```./h26forge generate -o vid.264```

This will use the default syntax element ranges found in [src/vidgen/generate_configurations.rs](../src/vidgen/generate_configurations.rs). You can also get these by adding `--save-default-config` to the instruction, which will create a `default.json` file in the current directory:
```./h26forge --save-default-config```

Recommended video generation command: `./h26forge --mp4 --mp4-frag --mp4-rand-size generate -o vid.264 --small --ignore-ipcm --ignore-edge-intra-pred`. This command will quickly generate small MP4 and H.264 bitstream files. See below for what each flag does.

**WARNING** Because we are generating semantically non-compliant videos, they may not decode correctly, even in H26Forge.

## Custom Ranges

You can modify the ranges that each syntax element takes on, but in many cases you are bounded by the type of entropy encoding that is used.

Here is a table of the types of entropy encoding found in H.264 videos, along with the usual ranges.
| Function | Range | Meaning |
|----------|-------|---------|
| ae(v):   | Depends on binarization     | Context Adaptive Binary Arithmetic Coded (CABAC)                     |
| ce(v):   | Depends on binarization     | Context Adaptive Variable-Length Coded (CAVLC)                       |
| f(n):    | $[0, 2^n]$                  | Fixed-pattern bit string using n bits written                        |
| i(n):    | $[-2^{n-1}, 2^{n-1} -1 ]$   | Signed integer using n bits                                          |
| me(v):   | Depends on binarization     | Mapped Exp-Golomb-coded syntax element with the left bit first       |
| se(v):   | Often $[-2^{31}, 2^{31}-1]$ | Signed integer Exp-Golomb-coded syntax element with the left bit first   |
| te(v):   | Depends on binarization     | Truncated Exp-Golomb-coded syntax element with the left bit first        |
| u(n):    | Often $[0, 2^{n}-1]$        | Unsigned integer using n bits. If "v" is used, then the number of bits varies depending on the value of other syntax elements |
| ue(v):   | Often $[0, 2^{32}-1]$       | Unsigned integer Exp-Golomb-coded syntax element with the left bit first |

For the most effective testing of H.264 decoders, create a custom configuration for your target by putting in the bounds from the target. Note that bounds may also depend on the type used to store the recovered syntax element.

Ranges in a config file are inclusive, so an upper bound on an $n$-bit number should be set to $2^n-1$.

### Example Custom Range

The file [config/chrome.json](../config/chrome.json) has its bounds set based on ranges found in the [Chromium h264 parser source code](https://github.com/chromium/chromium/blob/main/media/video/h264_parser.cc). This increases the likelihood that videos generated by H26Forge will explore undefined states in the decoder.

### Exact values

You can get exact values in the generated videos by setting `min` and `max` to the same value. For example, to generate videos with out-of-bounds `cpb_cnt_minus1`, both can be set to 255:

```json
"cpb_cnt_minus1": {
    "min": 255,
    "max": 255
},
```

### Limitations

H26Forge does not yet have complete support for H.264 spec, so certain syntax element values are not chosen. For example, H26Forge does not generate videos with `nal_unit_type` equal to 21, a "Coded slice extension for a depth view component or a 3D-AVC texture view" because it does not have support for 3D-AVC slices.

## Repeatable Random Videos

To produce the same video, you can set the `--seed <SEED>` flag to whatever value:
```./h26forge generate -o vid.264 --seed 1337```

Note that the seed value is also output while a video is being generated:
```
$ ./h26forge generate -o vid.264 --seed 1337

         using default random value ranges

                 SPS seq_parameter_set_id: 1
                 profile_idc: 128
                 level_idc: 41
...
```

### Fuzzing Integration Layer for Mutation (FILM) Interface

The Fuzzing Integration Layer for Mutation (FILM) interface is an attempt to integrate H26Forge with mutation-based fuzzers. It uses the parametric generator idea from Zest [[Padhye19]](https://rohan.padhye.org/files/zest-issta19.pdf). Basically a FILM file is treated as a source of randomness, where syntax elements are read as binary encoded values that are capped by the maximum set in the configuration. This approach has not been evaluated.

There are two components to the FILM interface: (1) outputting FILM; (2) reading FILM.

Film is output by adding the `--output-film` flag while generating a video. Each randomly sampled value will be saved as a binary value whose bit-length is based on its maximum possible value. For example, the command `./h26forge generate -o vid.264 --seed 1337 --output-film` will generate a file called `vid.264.film_file.seed_1337.bin`. Note that the random seed is also included in the filename.

FILM is read by passing in the `--film <FILMFILE>` parameter to H26Forge: `./h26forge generate -o vid2.264 --film vid.264.film_file.seed_1337.bin`. Every time that H26Forge samples a random value, it will read from the provided FILM file. If the FILM runs out, then H26Forge will fallback to a passed `--seed` value or a fresh randomly sampled seed.

A mutation-based fuzzer could perform mutation-based fuzzing to the FILM file, which H26Forge could use to generate a syntactically-correct H.264 file.

## Options

Here are all the options available for video generation.

### Output Options
- `--safestart`: Prepend a [known safe video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) to the output.
- `--mp4`: Output an MP4 file. If safestart is enabled, it will also output an MP4 of the prepended video.
- `--mp4-frag`: Makes the output MP4 into a [fragmented MP4 file](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/fragmented-mp4). This means that instead of the encoded bitstream existing as one big chunk in the MP4, each NALU will be separate, also containing its own AVCC. This is sometimes required for playing videos on the web. 
- `--mp4-rand-size`: Samples random values to set the output MP4 width and height. The range can be changed in the config file.
- `--mp4-width <width>`: Set the output MP4 width to a particular value.
- `--mp4-height <height>`: Set the output MP4 height to a particular value.
- `--avcc`: Produce a [WebCodecs](https://w3c.github.io/webcodecs/) friendly output file. This creates a `<output>.avcc.js` file that contains the AVCC extradata in [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/24890903/8169613) format. The variable `avcC` can be passed into a [VideoDecoderConfig](https://w3c.github.io/webcodecs/#dom-videodecoderconfig-description). See [CanIUse](https://caniuse.com/webcodecs) to identify support.
- `--rtp-replay`: Output an [rtpdump](https://webrtchacks.com/video_replay/) file. If safestart is enabled, decodable frames will be prepended to the rtpdump file. The config file for the generated dump is rtp_config/replay.config
- `--json`: Outputs the entire generated/parsed video as a [H264DecodedStream](../src/common/data_structures.rs#L13). Note that this file can get really big.
- `-e`: Outputs the generated entropy encoded values in a human readable format. This slows down video encoding, and may produce a really large file. This is best used for identifying what particular syntax element values are causing issues. 

### Randomness Options
- `--seed <seed>`: The random seed value used to generate a video.
- `--film <file>`: The file to use to sample from.
- `--output-film`: The randomly sampled values encoded in binary.

### Generated Video Options
- `--small`: Keeps the frame size to at most 128x128 pixels. This allows for faster video generation, but if testing a decoder for potential vulnerabilities, some effects from larger frame sizes may be missed.
- `--empty-slice-data`: Sets the slice data `coded_block_pattern` to 0, meaning there will be no residue information in slices. This allows for faster generation, but it may miss issues only found in hardware decoding.
- `--ignore-intra-pred`: Generate videos that do not rely on Intra prediction. All I slices have macroblock type INxN. This is to focus on issues that may arise from Inter prediction.
- `--ignore-edge-intra-pred`: Limits the Luma/Chroma Thief effect from being generated.
- `--ignore-ipcm`: Does not produce losslessly encoded PCM macroblock types.
- `--include-undefined-nalus`: Will generate random bytes for NALUs that are not defined in the spec.
